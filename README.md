Firstly, you need to have Ubuntu 20.04 on your raspberry pi 4.. After you install the ubuntu you can start to download opencv... then install ros noetic or humble but I recommend ros humble... 
once it is installed start to install mavros..... 
Once you are done... That means you are almost there to fly your drone....
After installing all the packages needed... start to create your own codes and you can use mine as a reference
